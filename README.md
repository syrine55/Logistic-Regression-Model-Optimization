# Logistic-Regression-Model-Optimization
Logistic Regression optimization using Gradient Descent 

âœ… The main purpose of this project is to build a logistic regression model from scratch and optimize it's weights with a variety of gradient descent algorithms and then building the final optimized model.
The evaluation metrics results were impressive when training both sklearn logistic regression model and our custom model outperformed the classic one. check the results in the notebook.
